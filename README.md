Obesity is a complex medical condition characterized by the excessive accumulation of body fat, resulting in adverse effects on health. It's typically determined by measuring Body Mass Index (BMI), which is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters (kg/m²). An adult with a BMI of 30 or higher is generally considered obese.
